[English:]
The waning moon has lit up
the insanity rampant in the shade
The laughter resounds around
It bares its fangs and its eyes gleam
I can't escape from it
It flickers slowly
appearing and disappearing in my mind
A nightmare rondo is being repeated
The awakening light
is gone far away out of my sight
I can do nothing but run
through the darkness
In the woods, in the fountain
I hide myself holding my breath
but it's still coming closer to me
A stagnant voice. An endless night
Ah...
If I can no longer get out of here
won't you show me your figure?
It flickers slowly
appearing and disappearing in my mind
A nightmare rondo is being repeated
The awakening light
is gone far away out of my sight
I can do nothing but fall
into the darkness
