Rondo Acapricio

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning to everyone that has just tuned in to this program
This is Lin Hsin Hsin from Singapore
I shall now read to you a poem in Mandarin
The title is "Xuéwèn," meaning "knowledge"
The poem is written last year
Here it goes

The next poem that I will read to you is in French
Titled "La Mariach"
This poem has been published in 1987
This is how it goes

Next I will play to you one of my digital compositions
Composed entirely without musical instruments
And without a sound card
The title of this work is "Rondo a Capriccio" in G, Opus 129
