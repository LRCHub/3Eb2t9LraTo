```
I think you better hide from me girl
tell me why we doin now
baby I'll be right back wit my Rondo?
hear you cry out in ya condo
I think you better hide from me girl
tell me why we doin now
baby I'll be right back wit my Rondo?
hear you cry out in ya condo
don't want you to know my name
want you to forget my last ward
RMK on your lips
we just met in a new world that you made
never felt bad why? let me know that
her hair like the doll
he like where the fuck she go?
I ain't got no car in garage but I'm better man
in those jeans I play like Ginuwine
one day make it big
like your sister see me on TV
I let you turn back then you maybe come back get
your own bag are you sure we won't back?
I think you better hide from me girl
tell me why we doin now
baby I'll be right back wit my Rondo?
hear you cry out in ya condo
I think you better hide from me girl
tell me why we doin now
baby I'll be right back wit my Rondo?
hear you cry out in ya condo
